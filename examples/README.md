# Examples

This directory is intended to provide several examples on how to use
the _physim_ library. To start off, the directory [command-line]() contains
simple examples that show how to use the library in a command line application.

In [interfaces]() one will find several subprojects that render a simulation
using the _physim_ library.

## Dependencies

All projects depend on the _qmake_ tool for building the projects, and a compiler
that supports C++11.

Whereas the [command-line]() examples do not depend on external libraries, other than
the _physim_ library, the [interfaces]() examples do. Its dependencies are the
following:
- [OpenGL]() (version >= 2.0).
- [GLUT]()
- [GLEW]()

## Building the examples

All the examples are built likewise. Create for each example a directory with the
name of the example finished with '-release', like this:

		mkdir command-line-release

Then, create the Makefile for each example:

		qmake -makefile command-line/command-line.pro -o command-line-release/Makefile

Navigate to the '-release' directory of the example and compile using the command:

		make
