Geometrical objects.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Geometrical objects. 

Namespace containing geometrical objects whose position does not depend on the interaction with other objects, namely, they remain fixed on the same place throughout the simulation.

Some of the geometrical objects are parametrised by their points, like geometry\+::triangle, geometry\+::sphere, geometry\+::plane, geometry\+::rectangle, but more general objects, see geometry\+::object, are supported. These general objects must be read from a file, see namespace \hyperlink{namespacephysim_1_1input}{physim\+::input}.
