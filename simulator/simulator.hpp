 \verbatim
 xc := current position

 new volcity = xc + time step * force / particle mass
 \endverbatim

 * - EulerSemi: implements a slightly different version from the

 * the velocity is updated first, and then the position is updated.
 *
 * - Verlet: this solver does not use the particle's velocity to update
 * its position. However, the velocity is still updated.

 new position = xc + k*(xc - xp) + force * time step * force / particle mass
