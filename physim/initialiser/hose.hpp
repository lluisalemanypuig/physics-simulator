/**
 * @brief A hose source class initialiser.
 *
 * This initialiser tries to make the particles have the
 * same behaviour as he water coming out of a hose. This
 * so-called hose has been abstracted as a cone.
 *
 * The cone is parametrised with a source, the vertex at the
 * peak of the cone (see @ref source), and with a circular base,
 * centered at a point (see @ref cc), that has radius @ref r.
 * The distance between the vertex and the center of the base
 * is the height of the cone (see @ref h). For easier calculations
 * this object stores the perpendicular unit vectors @ref v and @ref w
 * that span the plane containing the base. Also, the unit vector
 * @ref u that points from the source to the base.
 *
 * In order to define this cone one has to use method
 * @ref set_hose_source. This method needs the @ref source of the
 * hose (the peak of the cone), a unit vector that points
 * from the source to the base (see @ref u), the radius of the
 * base @ref r, and finally the height of the cone, @ref h.
 *
 * Particles are initialised with initial position @ref source.
 * The velocity is a random vector that goes from the @ref source
 * to a randomly generated point on the base of the cone.
 * Therefore the minimum speed the particles will have is
 * - \f$h\f$ (in case the point generated is exactly on the
 * middle of the base),
 * and the maximum is
 * - \f$\sqrt{h^2 + r^2}\f$ (in case the point generated lies
 * on the circumference of the base).
