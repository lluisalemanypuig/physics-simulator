		/* The main idea implemented in the following loop
		 * is the following:
		 *  -> We now know a prediction of the next position
		 *     of the particle thanks to the solver. This is
		 *     the "predicted position", stored in variable
		 *     'pred_pos'.
		 *
		 *  -> Now we have a segment ('prev_pos','pred_pos')
		 *     with which we can check collision with other
		 *     geometry.
		 *
		 *  -> However, we should not update the particle with
		 *     the first collision that has been detected.
		 *     Instead, a prediction of the result of the
		 *     collision is obtained and stored in 'pred_particle'.
		 *     This particle is called the "predicted particle".
		 *     Notice that this predicted particle also contains
		 *     the predicted velocity, and may have other attributes
		 *     modified after the collision (as part of the result
		 *	   of the collision).
		 *
		 *  -> Then, checking the collision is done with the
		 *     new segment from prev_pos to the position of
		 *     the predicted particle. The position of the
		 *     predicted particle, when there is any collision,
		 *     is stored in variable 'pred_pos'.
		 *
		 *  -> Therefore, after the first collision, we have
		 *     a prediction of the result of that collision
		 *     of the particle with some geometry. Then, the
		 *     second collision is detected with the segment
		 *     from the previous position ('prev_pos') and
		 *     the position of the predicted particle ('pred_pos').
		 *     However, be aware now that the result of the
		 *     second collision is NOT done with the state
		 *     of the predicted particle. Instead, it is done
		 *     with the original state of the particle.
		 *
		 *  -> The state that the particle takes is the state
		 *     of the predicted particle at the end of the loop
		 *     (only if there had been any collision).
