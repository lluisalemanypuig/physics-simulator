/**
 * @brief Class for sized particle initialisation.
 *
 * This class is used to initialise the attributes of a sized particle.
 *
 * This class has several functions as attributes, each of which
 * initialises an attribute of the particle.
 *
 * These functions are:
 * - @ref pos : function used to initialise the position of a particle.
 * - @ref vel : function used to initialise the velocity of a particle.
 * - @ref mass : function to initialise the mass of the particle.
 * - @ref charge : function used to initialise the charge of a particle.
 * - @ref friction : function used to initialise the friction coefficient of a particle.
 * - @ref bounce : function used to initialise the bouncing coefficient of a particle.
 * - @ref lifetime : function used to initialise the lifetime of a particle.
 * - @ref starttime : function used to initialise the starting time of a particle.
 * - @ref fixed : function used to initialise the fixed attribute of a particle.
 * - @ref radius : for the case of sized particles (see @ref particles::sized_particle,
 * this function is used to initialse the radius attribute of the particle).
 *
 * By default, all these function's behaviour is to initialise a particle
 * the same way they are initialised when constructed (see @ref free_particle::init).
 *
 * Also, they are applied in the same order as they appear listed.
 * Therefore, for example, the position attributes can be used to initialise
 * the velocity. Finally, it is guaranteed that all these functions
 * will be called after the @ref simulator has assigned an index to
 * the particle being initialised.
 *
 * The previous position of a particle is updated automatically after
 * initialising all attributes using the functions, but on the simulator.
 * Therefore, there is no need to initialise it.
 *
 * The initialisation of the particle takes place in the method
 * @ref initialise_particle(sized_particle&)const.
 *
 * Finally, all classes must implement the @ref clone function.
