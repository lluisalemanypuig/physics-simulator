 * @brief 1-Dimensional spring mesh.
 *
 * This represents a set of @ref particles::mesh_particle
 * where one particle is attached to at most two other
 * particles.
 *
 * If the local index of a particle is 0, then
 * that particle is connected only to particle with index 1.
 * Similarly, the particle with local index N - 1 is only
 * connected to that with index N - 2. The other particles
 * are connected to the particles with index \f$\pm 1\f$.
 *
 * In this type of meshes, there two types of internal forces
 * implemented by default:
 * - stretch: @ref stretch.
 * - bending: @ref bend.
 * These internal forces can be activated through the functions
 * - @ref simulate_stretch.
 * - @ref simulate_bend.
 * with an appropriate value of their parameter.
 * Depending on the type of mesh some of these forces may not be
 * implemented.
