/**
 * @brief 2-Dimensional regular spring mesh.
 *
 * This mesh's springs are organised in a grid: the particles at
 * the four corners have two neighbours, the particles at the border
 * of the grid (without considering the corners) have three neighbours,
 * and the rest have four.
 *
 * By neighbours it should be understood the immediate particle in
 * the grid. That is, in a grid of @e R and @e C particles in each
 * dimension the particle at \f$(i,j)\:|\: 0 \le i \le R - 1, 0 \le j \le C - 1\f$
 * has as neighbours the particles at \f$(i-1,j),(i+1,j),(i,j-1),(i,j+1)\f$.
 *
 * In this type of meshes, there three types of internal forces
 * implemented by default:
 * - stretch: @ref stretch.
 * - shear: @ref shear.
 * - bending: @ref bend.
 * These internal forces can be activated through the functions
 * - @ref simulate_stretch.
 * - @ref simulate_shear.
 * - @ref simulate_bend.
 * with an appropriate value of their parameter.
 * Depending on the type of mesh some of these forces may not be
 * implemented.

		 * @brief Original distances between the particles.

		 * Function @ref make_initial_state fills this vector
		 * with the distances between the particles that they
		 * had prior to calling this method.
		 *
		 * For a particle (@e i, @e j) the original distances are:
		 * - Stretch
		 *	- distance to (i, j + 1): in member @e x.
		 *	- distance to (i + 1, j): in member @e y.
		 * for \f$0 \le i \le R - 2, 0 \le j \le C - 2\f$.

		 *	- distance to (i, j + 2): in member @e z.
		 *	- distance to (i + 2, j): in member @e u.
		 * for \f$0 \le i \le R - 3, 0 \le j \le C - 3\f$.
		 *
		 * - Shear
		 *	- distance to (i - 1, j + 1): in member @e v.
		 * for \f$1 \le i \le R - 1, 0 \le j \le C - 2\f$.
		 *	- distance to (i + 1, j + 1): in member @e w.
		 * for \f$0 \le i \le R - 2, 0 \le j \le C - 2\f$.
		 *
		 * where @e C is the number of columns (see @ref C),
		 * and @e R is the number of rows (see @ref R).
		 *
		 * As a side note, there are some members that are not
		 * used at all. These are:
		 * - members @e z,@e u, for particles \f$(R-2,j), (i,C-2)\f$, for
		 * \f$0 \le i \le R - 2\f$ and \f$0 \le j \le C - 2\f$.
		 * - members @e v, for particles \f$(0,j)\f$, for \f$0 \le j \le C - 2\f$.
		 * - members @e w, for particles \f$(R-1,j)\f$, for \f$0 \le j \le C - 2\f$.
		 *
		 * where @e C is the number of columns (see @ref C),
		 * and @e R is the number of rows (see @ref R).
